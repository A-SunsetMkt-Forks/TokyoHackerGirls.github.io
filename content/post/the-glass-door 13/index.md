You are a child of the universe,
like every blade of grass, every tree, and every bloom.

You are no more and no less than them, an existence born to live and destined to die.

You hold the right to grow as wild as flowers, to love and be loved, like birds in flight, wing to wing, heart to heart.

But above all, you are in this world, as we all are, to roam under this endless sky and feel the sunlight.
