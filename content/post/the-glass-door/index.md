The warm autumn sun trickled through the slatted windows, its gentle breeze like the steady breathing of a cat in peaceful slumber. Lying quietly in the loft bed, I gazed upon the lovely face of Asahi Lina.

I cherish these moments when I can simply observe her. Her face is captivating - delicate lashes, curved brow when she smiles, and eyes that shine like sparkling diamonds. This angelic countenance is ever so softly smiling at me, her silken tresses cascading over me like the Milky Way.

Occasionally, she seems enveloped by the radiance of our happiness, gently closing her eyes as she utters with the delight of the first glimmer of dawn, "I can hardly believe this." "I'm so lucky to have found you."

We look into each other's eyes and smile. She tenderly touches her nose to mine, and I reciprocate with a loving chuckle - a pure, animal-like expression of our affection.

I wish to fully comprehend this feeling, the voice in my mind whispering, "Look at her once more." How long can such bliss in life endure? One day, she may become a memory that has passed me by, and I may never again experience these precious moments.

I love you, so much.
