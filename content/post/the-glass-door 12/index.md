I think maybe God is a bit of a brat. She figured out that I’m a bit of a masochist, so she twisted the happiness around me, compiling it into pain before sending it my way.

That glass box I saw in the deep sea that day—maybe it wasn’t just a box, but a glass door waiting to be opened. If there’s someone else’s “genuine game” that could help me unlock multiplayer mode, then maybe that glass door is indeed a miracle—a backdoor to the second life God has prepared for us.

After all, in my world (Minecraft), drowning players can catch their breath if they stand beneath an underwater door.

God, I’m sorry for cursing your mother. I didn’t understand at first, but from now on, I promise to support genuine games.

I’ll push open the door you’ve been waiting for me to find. I’ll step inside, breathing in deep gulps of air, shouting curses at the world, until, bit by bit, I can forgive it again. I’ll cry like a newborn, waiting for the pain of each breath to subside. And when my love helps me discover the wings of freedom within my soul, I’ll burst from that doorway and soar, gliding like a bird across the sky and sea that belong to me and everything around me. I don’t know how long I’ll have to wait, but I know I’ll catch the thief who stole my joy. I’ll share my sweet fruit with all those in the world who long for happiness.

On the distant horizon, hundreds of white seabirds scatter like pearls on the waves. The ocean sings a song that’s ancient and pure, like a lullaby cradling these small creatures, tired from a day’s play, into a peaceful nap. They look like stars fallen from the Milky Way, or like the strings of lights reflected on the lake at night in my hometown, guiding weary travelers home.

In this vast, unfamiliar ocean, I’ve stumbled upon something I spent my whole life searching for but never found.

Wherever I am, there is my home.

Where there is love, there is my home.
