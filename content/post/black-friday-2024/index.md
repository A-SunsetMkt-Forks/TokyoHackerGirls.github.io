# 2024 Black Friday Tech Recommendations

## Hi there, Cyber Wonders

It‚Äôs Black Friday again! Today, I‚Äôm sharing some of my all-time favorite tech products that have genuinely improved my quality of life and boosted my happiness.

### About Me

Hi, I am Cyan! I‚Äôm a aspiring anime artist and singer, with over a decade of experience as a coding enthusiast. For the past few years, I worked for Google in North America, and in my spare time, I run a YouTube channel filled with gaming, covers, videos, and live streams. I‚Äôm also the fianc√©e of Asahi Lina, a Linux kernel developer for Asahi Linux. These recommendations are treasures that have greatly helped us in work efficiency, creative endeavors, and relaxation.

Let‚Äôs dive right in!

![MacBook](mac.jpg)

### **1. MacBook Air / MacBook Pro (For Everyone)**
- **Why I Recommend It**: MacBooks have been my go-to machine for college, grad school, and work at Google. They‚Äôre fantastic for coding, drawing, and recording. My 2014 MacBook Air lasted me seven years before I upgraded to a Pro, which handles video editing, Minecraft, VTube Studio, and streaming like a champ. Both the M1 and M2 models now support Asahi Linux, with M3 and M4 support in the future. Air does great for most people. Need performance for video editing, AI training, or intensive coding tasks? Grab the Pro.

![iPad](ipad.jpg)

### **2. iPad (For Students, Artists, and Media Creators)**
- **Why I Recommend It**: It‚Äôs a perfect blend of work and play. Add a keyboard, and it‚Äôs almost like a mini computer. For someone like me who loves taking notes and drawing, paired with the Apple Pencil and a paper-like screen protector, it feels like a digital notebook/sketchbook that can be archived. It‚Äôs also my main tool for creating anime-style art. While I don‚Äôt recommend iPads as a primary coding device for CS students‚ÄîSSH over school networks can be unreliable‚Äîit‚Äôs a fantastic secondary productivity tool.
- **Black Friday Deal**: Save $100‚Äì$200

![Alienware](alienware.jpg)

### **3. Alienware Gaming Desktop**
- **Why I Recommend It**: This was my first streaming machine. It‚Äôs not the cheapest, but it‚Äôs reliable out of the box. OBS streaming is seamless, and it handles graphics-heavy games like Cyberpunk 2077 (with 4080/4090 GPUs) effortlessly. If you have the budget and want a pre-built desktop, this is it.

![Apple Watch](watch.jpg)

### **4. Apple Watch Series 10**
- **Why I Recommend It**: I got this for health reasons and its integration with the Apple ecosystem. It monitors heart rate, sleep, and a few potentially life-saving features. My favorite part is the Walkie-Talkie feature. It‚Äôs like having a private intercom system at home. Make sure to try different bands; rubber ones may cause irritation if worn for too long.
- **Black Friday Deal**: $379 (Rose Gold)

![Herman Miller Chair](herman.jpg)

### **5. Herman Miller Ergonomic Chair**
- **Why I Recommend It**: Sitting properly is crucial for health. After my father underwent a life-threatening surgery due to poor posture, I realized how important a good chair is. I‚Äôve tried gaming chairs, kneeling chairs, IKEA‚Äôs MARKUS, and more, but Herman Miller chairs are the only ones that keep my back pain-free for hours. They‚Äôre pricey, but they‚Äôre worth it for those who work long hours. Pro tip: Check secondhand markets for great deals! The second-hand chairs from big companies are usually much cheaper and really good for your back.
- **Black Friday Deal**: 15%‚Äì25% off

![AirPods Pro](airpod.jpg)

### **6. AirPods Pro**
- **Why I Recommend It**: These are my most essential tools. From music playback and Siri interactions to ASMR meditations at night, they‚Äôre perfect. While the regular AirPods can easily fall out during sleep, the Pro model is much more secure and comfortable for extended wear.
- **Black Friday Deal**: $169.99 ($80 off)

![](tag.jpg)

### **7. AirTag**
- **Why I Recommend It**: I have around 12 of these at home‚Äîthey‚Äôre just that useful! Each pet gets one on their collar, and thanks to the ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù feature, I‚Äôve recovered my runaway cats and dogs countless times. They can literally be life-saving. They‚Äôre also great for tracking wallets, purses, bags, keys, and more. Remember, the batteries will need replacing eventually. Creators, beware of receiving gifts with hidden trackers inside. When traveling, stay vigilant for unknown AirTags‚Äîyou‚Äôll receive an alert on your iPhone if one is near.
- **Black Friday Deal**: 4-pack for just $72.99  
- [Check it out](https://m.dealmoon.com/en/69-apple-airtag-4-pack/4587103.html)

### **8. Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 Instant Camera**
- **Why I Recommend It**: Why bother with an instant camera in the smartphone age? Because physical photos carry so many memories. Clip them onto a string and create a photo wall‚Äîsuper romantic!
- **Black Friday Deal**: Bundle for just $69.99  
- [Check it out](https://m.dealmoon.com/en/mini-11-for-59-fujifilm-instax/4608439.html)

### **9. Steam Deck OLED 1TB**

![](yeti.jpg)

### **10. Blue Yeti USB Microphone**
- **Why I Recommend It**: This was my first streaming mic, and it‚Äôs perfect for beginners‚Äîeasy to use with great quality. Show up to a work Zoom standup with this beast, and everyone will compliment your professional sound. ‚ÄúAre you a YouTuber?‚Äù they‚Äôll ask. Instant icebreaker, and you‚Äôre suddenly the team favorite. According to Lina though, with good audio processing, cheaper microphones are also great - like the ones we use in Europe, Behringer Ultravoice.
- **Black Friday Deal**: Just $76.49

![](standing.jpg)

### **11. Standing Desk**
- **Why I Recommend It**: Sitting too long? Stand for a while! Bonus points if you add a treadmill underneath. If you‚Äôre on a budget, IKEA lets you customize your own desktop. Lina loves hers, but you‚Äôll need to manage the cables underneath carefully‚Äîotherwise, a spilled drink could be disastrous. Our cats were initially curious about the rising desk, but now they‚Äôre totally unbothered.
- **Black Friday Deal**: As low as $79  
- [Check it out](https://m.dealmoon.com/en/as-low-as-79-flexispot-select-standing-desks-on-sale/4605658.html)

### **12. Focusrite Scarlett 2i2**
- **Why I Recommend It**: A must-have for recording. Perfect for live streaming and song recording. Lina and I absolutely love using it for our content.

![](stream.jpg)

### **13. Elgato Stream Deck**
- **Why I Recommend It**: A must-have for serious streamers. Seamlessly switch OBS scenes and VTuber expressions with a single press. Automate your streaming start and end routines, and ensure your mic and stream settings are not accidentally on/off every time. Depending on your needs, there are different sizes available. After all, they are just buttons - for DIY enthusiasts, you can even build your own button deck.

### **14. Wacom Drawing Tablet**
- **Why I Recommend It**: A must-have for artists! Not an artist? Try osu!‚Äîclick the circles! A Wacom tablet with minimal specs is more than enough for osu! and works great for drawing, too.
- [Check it out](https://www.amazon.com/wacom/s?k=wacom)

### **15. CO2 Monitor**
- **Why I Recommend It**: Feeling dizzy every day? Your room‚Äôs CO2 levels might be over 3000 ppm. Lina and I discovered this recently‚Äîit turns out working without fresh air can literally make you lightheaded. We bought it on AliExpress and we enjoyed it so far.

---


### **16. LG 27-Inch Portable Screen**
- **Why I Recommend It**: I gifted one to my aunt for her birthday, and it‚Äôs a game-changer. This portable screen is perfect for watching shows in bed, exercising in the living room, lounging on the couch, following recipes in the kitchen, and staying connected with family. I‚Äôm seriously tempted to get one for myself!

### **17. Stanley Quencher Tumbler**
- **Why I Recommend It**: While not a gadget, it‚Äôs essential for us programmers/streamers who forget to hydrate. Since getting this tumbler, I‚Äôve been drinking so much water that I accidentally lost some weight. I love half-iced water, and Stanley‚Äôs insulation keeps it cool overnight. It‚Äôs also great for hot drinks‚Äîjust avoid using the straw with anything boiling.

### **18. Electric Mug Warmer**
- **Why I Recommend It**: A warm drink in winter is pure bliss, especially when it stays hot for hours.
